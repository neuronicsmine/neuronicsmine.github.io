								<h3>Title: Neural computations underlying cognition</h3>

								<p>
								How does our brain enable us to pay attention selectively to some things, and to ignore others? What happens in the brain when we make important decisions? Our research focuses on understanding the neural basis of cognitive phenomena such as selective attention and decision making. To address these questions, our group has developed quantitative approaches that combines neuroscience experiments, model-based analyses (e.g., signal detection theory, machine learning, dynamical systems) as well as computer simulations. Using cutting-edge, non-invasive techniques, including functional neuroimaging (fMRI), diffusion imaging (dMRI), high-density electroencephalography (EEG), and transcranial electrical and magnetic stimulation (tES/tMS), we directly measure or perturb brain activity in human subjects performing cognitively-demanding tasks. The overarching goal is to develop a unified framework that describes how cognitive phenomena emerge from neural computations by a systematic analysis of brain and behavior.

								<h3>Title: Red induces strong gamma oscillations in the brain</h3>

								<p>
									What changes inside the brain when one sees a colourful flower as opposed to a grayscale
									version of it? How do the brain signals change when one sees a green jackfruit versus a red
									tomato? Does the redness of the tomato matter? We studied such questions by recording
									signals from the primary visual cortex (an area of brain involved in visual processing) of
									monkeys while they were shown various natural images. To our surprise, we found that there
									were strong oscillations in the recorded signals at frequencies in the range 30-80 Hz
									whenever reddish images were shown. Oscillations in this range are traditionally known as
									gamma oscillations and have been previously linked to functions such as attention, working
									memory and meditation. To investigate this further, we presented uniform colour stimuli of
									different hues and found that gamma was indeed sensitive to the hue of the colour, with
									reddish hues generating the strongest gamma. In the visual cortex, gamma has been known to
									be induced strongly by gratings (alternating black and white stripes), but the gamma
									generated by colour stimuli was even stronger, almost 10-fold in some cases. The magnitude
									of gamma depended on the purity of the colour but not so much on the overall brightness.
									Importantly, it was related to a particular mechanism by which colour signals received by the
									retinal cone receptors are processed in the brain. These findings provide new insights about
									the generation of gamma oscillations and processing of colour in the brain.

								<h3>Title: An Analogue Neuromorphic Co-Processor That Utilizes Device Mismatch for Learning Applications</h3>

								<p>
									As  the  integrated  circuit  (IC)  technology  advances
									into smaller nanometre feature sizes, a fixed-error noise known as
									device mismatch is introduced owing to the dissimilarity between
									transistors,  and  this  degrades  the  accuracy  of  analog  circuits.
									We  present  an  analog  co-processor  that  uses  this
									fixed-pattern noise to its advantage to perform complex computa-
									tion. This circuit is an extension of our previously published train-
									able analogue  block  (TAB) framework  and uses  multiple inputs
									that  substantially  increase  functionality.  We  present  measure-
									ment results of  our  two-input analogue  co-processor  built using
									a  130-nm  process  technology  and  show  its  learning  capabilities
									for  regression  and  classification  tasks.  We  also  show  that  the
									co-processor,  comprised  of  100  neurons,  is  a  low-power  system
									with  a  power  dissipation  of  only  1.1Î¼W.  The  IC  fabrication
									process  contributes  to  randomness  and  variability  in  ICs,  and
									we  show  that  random  device  mismatch  is  favorable   for  the
									learning capability  of  our  system  as  it  causes  variability  among
									the  neuronal  tuning  curves.  The  low-power  capability  of  our
									framework  makes it suitable for use in various  battery-powered
									applications ranging from  biomedical to military  as  a  front-end
									analog  co-processor.

								<h3>Title: Multiplicative mixing of object identity and	image attributes in single inferior temporal neurons</h3>

								<p>
									Knowing a Ferrari from a Mustang from an image can be hard because one has
									to detect their unique features while ignoring large image variations due to
									changes in view, size, position etc. Successful recognition requires both object
									identity and image attributes to be represented efficiently but precisely how the
									brain does it has been unclear. Recent work from our lab has shown that single
									neurons in high-level visual areas combine these two signals by multiplying
									rather than adding them, and that doing so enables efficent decoding of both
									signals.
